		#Arguments Explained:
		#  1. Type:       'NBT' (checks player data) or 'EFFECT' (checks potion amplifier/level).
		#  2. Key:        The NBT path (e.g. 'thirstLevel') or Effect ID (e.g. 'minecraft:poison').
		#  3. Comparator: Logic for calculating the penalty.
		#       SCALE MODES (Linear penalty between two points):
		#         >  : Penalty increases as value rises above Threshold, maxing at WorstValue.
		#         <  : Penalty increases as value falls below Threshold, maxing at WorstValue.
		#       MULTIPLIER MODE (Penalty stacks per unit):
		#         * : (or *>) Each point ABOVE Threshold adds MaxPenalty to total.
		#              Formula: (CurrentValue - Threshold) * MaxPenalty
		#         *< : Each point BELOW Threshold adds MaxPenalty to total.
		#              Formula: (Threshold - CurrentValue) * MaxPenalty
		#       INSTANT FLAG:
		#         !  : Add ! before any comparator (!>, !<, !*, !*<) to apply penalty instantly.
		#              Without !, penalties build up gradually over time.
		#  4. Threshold:  The safe value where penalty starts (0%).
		#  5. WorstValue: In SCALE mode: The value where penalty reaches 100%.
		#                 In MULTIPLIER mode: The Maximum total penalty allowed (Hard Cap).
		#  6. MaxPenalty: In SCALE mode: Total penalty amount at WorstValue.
		#                 In MULTIPLIER mode: Penalty amount per 1 unit of difference.
		#  7. ColorInt:   Decimal color code for the HUD overlay (e.g. 16711680 is Red).
		#  8. IconText:   Emoji or text to display on the bar. Write 'none' to disable.
